# Directus
Directus, backend as service
https://directus.io/

This repository is dedicated exclusively to tasks related to Directus, the backend powering the Enaleia Hub.

This approach was chosen to align with Enaleia’s core team capacity and focus areas—marine cleanup and fisher community building. By leveraging Directus, the system ensures long-term sustainability with minimal maintenance requirements.

All development work will take place within Directus’s interface and sandbox environment.
